# FeatherAI: Lightweight AI for Speed Demons
FeatherAI is designed for those who prioritize speed and simplicity. Through HTML, I wanna deliver fast and efficient LLM responses.

## üöÄ Core Principles:

- Minimalism: We focus on core functionality and performance, aiming for a streamlined approach using only **HTML** and **Python**. (Calling for talent, please let me know if you have better ideas.)
- Speed: HTML's inherent speed ensures rapid response times, making FeatherAI ideal for this simple task.
## üí™ Introducing Macro (Optional):

(You can choose to include the Macro section if you're planning to make the whole thing being run **arbitrarily**)

Macro extends FeatherAI's functionality by leveraging the power of macro software. Think of it as a powerful extension that lets you trigger Python scripts with a single click **arbitrarily**, streamlining your AI interactions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Macro (Optional):

1. Install your chosen macro software: **Logitech Options+** is a great option, but feel free to explore other alternatives.
2. Create a macro: Within your macro software, create a new macro that executes your desired Python script.
2. Assign a shortcut: Assign a keyboard shortcut to your macro for easy access. (e.g. Ctrl + Shift + Alt + 1)
3. Trigger your AI: With a single execution of your assigned shortcut, your Python script will run, leveraging FeatherAI's capabilities.
### üíª Benefits of FeatherAI:

- Lightweight: FeatherAI's small codebase makes it easy to implement and maintain.
- Fast: HTML ensures rapid response times, perfect for time-sensitive applications.
- Efficient: FeatherAI's minimalist approach prioritizes performance and resource efficiency.
