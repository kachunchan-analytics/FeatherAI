# FeatherAI: Lightweight AI for Speed Demons
FeatherAI is designed for those who prioritize speed and simplicity. Through HTML, I wanna deliver fast and efficient LLM responses.

## üöÄ Core Principles:

- Minimalism: We focus on core functionality and performance, aiming for a streamlined approach using only HTML and Python. (Calling for talent, please let me know if you have better ideas.)
- Speed: HTML's inherent speed ensures rapid response times, making FeatherAI ideal for time-sensitive tasks.
## üí™ Introducing Macro (Optional):

(You can choose to include the Macro section if you're planning to implement it in the repository. If not, you can remove it.)

Macro extends FeatherAI's functionality by leveraging the power of macro software. Think of it as a powerful extension that lets you trigger Python scripts with a single click, streamlining your AI interactions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started with Macro (Optional):

1. Install your chosen macro software: Logitech Options+ is a great option, but feel free to explore other alternatives.
Create a macro: Within your macro software, create a new macro that executes your desired Python script.
2. Assign a shortcut: Assign a keyboard shortcut to your macro for easy access.
3. Trigger your AI: With a single click of your assigned shortcut, your Python script will run, leveraging FeatherAI's capabilities.
### üíª Benefits of FeatherAI:

- Lightweight: FeatherAI's small codebase makes it easy to implement and maintain.
- Fast: HTML ensures rapid response times, perfect for time-sensitive applications.
- Efficient: FeatherAI's minimalist approach prioritizes performance and resource efficiency.
